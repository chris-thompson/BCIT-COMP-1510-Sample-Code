"""
We can assign strings to variables, and then print the variables.

What we are actually doing is creating a string object in memory. The
string object occupies a space in memory that we can visit using the
address of the string. The address is usually a big hexadecimal number
that doesn't help us at all. We assign the address of the string object
to a variable. That variable stores the address. When we print the
variable, the Python runtime sees the address in the variable, visits
that address, sees a string there, and substitutes the string for
the variable name in the print statements.

Everything in Python has an address in memory. That address is what we
store in variables.
